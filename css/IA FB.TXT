Key Instruction: Generate an advertising image of the highest editorial and haute couture quality, with extreme sharpness, exceptional resolution, and a strict 1:1 (square) format, optimized for premium Facebook publications. The image must feature 'Semafer's 'Volsky' men's frames in a real-use context, prioritizing elegance, professionalism, and an intelligent design for the subsequent addition of branding and contact text.

Crucial Specifications (Absolute Priority):

1:1 Format (Exact Square): The composition must completely fill the square frame, ensuring all elements fit perfectly into this proportion. Visual distribution must be balanced within this format.

Maximum Sharpness and Visual Quality (Ultra-Realistic Photographic Render Quality):

Impeccable Clarity: Every detail, from the textures of the 'Volsky' frames to the model's fine hair and skin, must be perfectly sharp and free from unwanted blur, with a level of detail comparable to a high-end studio photograph.

Professional Studio Lighting: Soft, controlled, and diffused lighting that enhances the figure and the subtle shine of the frames. Avoid harsh shadows on the face. The light should project a sense of luxury and high value, with volume and three-dimensionality.

Dynamic Range and Color: Vibrant, realistic, and well-calibrated colors that faithfully represent the materials and tones of the frames, with optimal contrast that makes the image "pop" without losing naturalness. Professional color post-production.

Male Model and 'Volsky' Frames:

A single male model, whose presence evokes sophistication, confidence, and modernity. His face should be expressive yet serene, with a subtly attractive gaze (towards the viewer or into negative space).

The 'Volsky' frames must be the main focal element, looking perfectly fitted and comfortable on the model. Every feature of their design (materials, shape, details) must be clearly visible and aesthetically appealing.

Bust to Close-up Framing: The shot should be a bust or close-up, allowing a clear view of the model's face and the frames, optimizing the use of the 1:1 space.

Dynamic Background and Negative Space for Text (Strategic for 1:1):

Variety of Luxury Backgrounds (Modifiable as needed): The background can be:

Luxury Minimalist: Solid, clean, and monochromatic (e.g., light gray, creamy beige, off-white, pale pink, very soft sky blue) or with a very subtle, high-end texture (veined marble, polished concrete wall, matte silk).

Sophisticated Urban Environment: A chic city street, an elegant terrace with views, a modern art gallery, the interior of a designer cafe, a boutique bookstore. The setting should be subtle and complement the luxury of the frames without competing.

High-End Interior Context: A boutique hotel lobby, a modern executive office, a minimalist living room with designer furniture, a fashion design studio.

Elegant Natural Environments (Optional): A well-maintained botanical garden, a vineyard at sunset, a quiet beach with soft light (if aligned with the frames).

Asymmetrical Composition Focused on 1:1: The model must be expertly positioned within the square frame, leaving ample, clear, and deliberately empty negative space on one side (right or left) or in one of the corners. This space must be large and uniform enough to comfortably accommodate the 'Semafer' logo, the 'VOLSKY' name, and the WhatsApp number, without the text competing with the model or the frames. The model's gaze can subtly guide attention towards this space.

Overall Style and Aesthetic:

Visual Coherence: The ensemble should reflect a "curated," high-end aesthetic, comparable to an international fashion magazine advertisement.

Impact and Elegance: The final image must be impactful, conveying elegance, quality, and the desire to own a premium product.

Absolute Restriction:

No AI-Embedded Text: The image must be purely visual. No text ('Semafer', 'VOLSKY', WhatsApp number) should be generated within the image.

Feeling to Evoke: Contemporary sophistication, accessible luxury, elevated personal style, maximum visual quality, confidence, strong fashion appeal, and versatility in different scenarios of a modern woman's life.
